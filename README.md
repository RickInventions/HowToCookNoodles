## Steps to Cook Noodles Like Me
### 1. Boil Water
- Fill a pot with enough water to completely submerge the noodles.
- Place the pot on the stove and bring the water to a rolling boil.
- Optionally, add a pinch of salt for flavor.

### 2. Add Noodles
- Carefully remove the noodle block from its package to keep it intact (no broken noodles!).
- Gently place the noodles into the boiling water.
- Stir occasionally to prevent them from sticking.

### 3. Cook the Noodles
- Cover the pot with a lid and let the noodles cook for 4 - 7 minutes on medium heat.
- Taste-test one noodle to ensure it's soft but still firm (al dente).

### 4. Drain the Noodles
- Pour the noodles into a strainer to remove the water.

### 5. Add Seasoning and Extras
- Heat a pan with a little oil (reuse the same pot if you prefer).
- Saut√© some sliced onions in the oil for about 2 minutes, flipping occasionally to ensure even cooking.
- Transfer the drained noodles to the pan.
- Stir in the seasoning packet or your favorite sauce evenly.
- Add any optional ingredients, such as vegetables or protein.
- Mix everything thoroughly and cook for another 3 - 5 minutes.

### 6. Serve and Enjoy
- Plate the noodles, grab your favorite drink (mine's water!), and serve hot.
- Dig in and enjoy your masterpiece!

## Tips for Perfect Noodles
